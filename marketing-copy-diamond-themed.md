**Subject**: "How to spot your diamond clarity ðŸ’Ž"

"Hi [Name],

Yesterday you started tracking your daily patterns. Today, let's talk about what you're looking for: Diamond Clarity.

Diamond Clarity happens when:
âœ… Your energy level hits 3-5 (not too low, not too high)
âœ… Your focus level hits 3-5 (alert but calm)
âœ… The conditions are just right

When this happens, you'll see the diamond emoji ðŸ’Ž in your app. That's your signal - you've found a moment of perfect mental clarity.

Pay attention to what led to this moment:
â€¢ How much sleep did you get?
â€¢ What did you eat?
â€¢ What time of day is it?
â€¢ How are you feeling emotionally?

These insights become your personal clarity formula.

Keep tracking,
The FlowState Team"

### About Section
**"The Science Behind Diamond Clarity"**

"FlowState was born from a simple observation: our best mental states aren't random. They follow patterns.

After studying thousands of daily check-ins, we discovered that peak mental clarity occurs in a specific zone - what we call Diamond Clarity ðŸ’Ž. This happens when energy and focus levels align in the 3-5 range, creating conditions for optimal cognitive performance.

Unlike other tracking apps that focus on extremes (highest energy, maximum focus), FlowState recognizes that brilliance comes from balance. Just like a diamond's beauty emerges from precise cuts and perfect proportions, your mental clarity emerges from the right combination of energy, focus, and environmental factors.

Our mission: Help you discover, understand, and recreate your moments of Diamond Clarity."

### Privacy Section
**"Your Clarity, Your Data"**

"Your mental insights are precious. That's why FlowState operates on a privacy-first principle:

â€¢ All data stays on your device
â€¢ No cloud storage without your permission
â€¢ Full export capabilities in CSV format
â€¢ Anonymous sharing options for research
â€¢ No ads, no social features, no distractions

Your journey to clarity should remain yours. We simply provide the tools to discover it."
